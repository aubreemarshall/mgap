    <center><h1>Structure 14</h1></center>
    <br></br>
<div>
    <center><big><p>Structure 14 is located around the central plaza. Simmons and Graham (2017) found that Structures 12 and 14 were first built during the end of the Classic period and was occupied into the Early Postclassic. Structure 14 is considered a high-status residence for a few reasons.</p></big></center>
    <br></br>
        
    <center><big><p>First, there are over 40 burials that have been identified at the site, with an additional 5 uncovered during the 2023 field season. These burials have had several grave goods indicating that these are high-status individuals, such as jaguar teeth, obsidian, beads, and pottery. Below is an example of one of these ceramics, a polychrome vessel with a sectioned conch shell design (from Simmons and Graham, 2017).</p></big></center>

    <br></br>
        
        <center><big><p>Some grave goods traveled a good distance to get to Marco Gonzalez, including obsidian from El Chayal and plumbate from the Pacific coast (both of which can be found on the <a href="mesomap.html"> Mesoamerica Map</a>).</p></big></center>
    <br></br>

    <center><h2>2023 field season</h2></center>
    <br></br>

    <center><big><p>Structures 12, 14, and 19 are built with deposits of salt processing debris as it's core material (Simmons and Graham, 2017). During the 2023 field season, we had the opportunity to explore this further on the west side of Structure 14.</p></big></center>

    <br></br>

    <center><img src='img/IMG_6763.jpeg' style= 'width:400px'></center>

    <br></br>

    <center><big><p>Above you can see the layers of Coconut Walk ceramic sherds (the lighter, orange-ish color) and Maya Dark Earth (consisting of large amounts of charcoal, which is where the dark color comes from). You can also see a line of rocks on the left side of the image - this may be a part of a hearth. This season involved using photogrammetry as a first line of evidence, which meant taking a lot of photos and creating a 3D model of each unit at different levels. We can then look at how the levels change as we dug deeper. We were also able to compare the two different Operations, where we were able to potentially identify another section of the hearth.</p></big></center>
    <br></br>
        
        <center><big><p>One goal for the 2024 field season is to explore the hearth feature further to see if it expands throughout the center of Structure 14!</p></big></center>
    <br></br>

    <center><big><p>Some of the special finds that came from Structure 14 during the field season included a ceramic sherd with glyphs on it, the first found at Marco Gonzalez! There were others found later in the season, but they were not as large as this sherd.</p></big></center>

    <br></br>

    <center><big><p>As you can see above, several of the glyphs are legible. Frank Tzib translated the glyphs, which say <em>ujay yuk'ib</em>, or 'the drinking vessel [of]...'. The fish head would have been the beginning of a name (Kratimenos et al., 2023).</p></big></center>
    <br></br>

    <center><big><p>There was a cache found in the western side of the structure that included a conch shell ocarina that resembled a parrotfish, a lump of rubber with an imprint of a textile (maybe the bag that held it), a pair of shell ear spools, and a worked bone fan handle, all pictured below (Kratimenos et al., 2023).</p></big></center>
