    <br></br>
<div>
    <center><big><p>Structure 12 is located around the central plaza. As of 1990, 4 burials have been identified in Structure 12 (Pendergast and Graham, 1990). Graham and Pendergast (1989) also explain that there were a high number of postholes and pits on Structure 12, indicating that a timber and thatch structure would have been on top of the structure that we see today!</p></big></center>
    <br></br>

    <center><big><p>Additionally, Structures 12, 14, and 19 are built with deposits of salt processing debris as it's core material (Simmons and Graham, 2017).</p></big></center>
    <br></br>

    <center><big><p>Simmons and Graham (2017) found that Structures 12 and 14 were first built during the end of the Classic period and was occupied into the Early Postclassic. Simmons and Graham also share that Structure 12 also had a early Colonial period cache that had effigy head vessels.</p></big></center>
    <br></br>

    <center><big><p>It seems that, after the last bit of construction on Structure 12, several offerings were deposited below the building's surface, including the jadite drawn below (Graham and Pendergast, 1989).</p></big></center>
