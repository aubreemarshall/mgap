            <!--Understanding how different communities and regions interacted with one another is integral to understanding how communities survived and navigated larger events, including the Classic Maya Collapse. As MG is located relatively close to the modern town of San Pedro, a hub for tourism, the website can provide more information about MG as tourists visit. It will provide more information for anyone interested in the site and how it’s connected to larger Mesoamerica.
            
            Deliverables and outcomes will include a mobile phone website that can be utilized by the public. The project will be place-based; it will consist of a map of Mesoamerica with points in areas where artifacts from MG would have come, which structure they were found in at MG, and more information on the artifact and the location (for example, some ceramics came from the Pacific coast, so there would be a point there; once clicked, there will be an image of the artifact with more information on the artifact and what structure they were found in at MG, as well as more information on the communities located on the Pacific coast). The domain name will be “belizemgap”. 

            There will be a second subsection with a map of Mesoamerica with the points of where artifacts came from, providing more information about said location and the artifact.
